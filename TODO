  @ BUG: behave mouse-click doesn't work right. 
    http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=42
  @ BUG: This types the wrong symbols:
      setxkbmap -option grp:switch,grp:shifts_toggle se,us
      xdotool "type" '`12345678990-=~!@#$%^&*()_+[]{}'
      Result: ¶12345678990\=¾ !²#¼%⅝&«()¿+[]{}
  @ FEATURE: snapshot and restore window geometries? Maybe best as a script.
